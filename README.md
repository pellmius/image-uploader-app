# image-uploader-app
### Simple image uploader app using Node.Js and Express for my backend development portfolio.

# How it works
Write anything on the library textspace, - that will be your library that you can access later - select an image to upload on the form and click on the submit button to upload. You will receive a message with the link for the file.
Rate limits 1 request per minute.

# How files are stored
Files are stored in the uploads directory which contains subdirectories for each IP Address that uploads.
